Hello,
I'm Alexey from Belarus.
I introduce myself 'cause I ready to move further to my aim.
My deep conviction that there are no problems that can not be solved, 
and everything is limited only by human fears.
I know that I am able to solve problems of any complexity, it's only time.
I like to solve complex problems, put out fires and show myself what I'm capable of. 
Routine life is not interesting. Therefore, every task, even insignificant, must end at least with a tiny victory. 
It is the most powerful engine of progress and self-motivation
I've been developing software for a 3 years. 
I took a part in a different projects such as large distributed bank systems, mobile advertising, service for search temporary employees and etc.
I am sure that I would take an active part in the achievement of the company's goals.
Have a nice day.
Thank you.
