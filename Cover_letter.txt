Hi guys,
I'm Alexey from Belarus.
I introduce myself to you 'cause I ready to move further to my aim.
The last few years, I'm only doing what I learn something new in my profession. 
My deep conviction that there are no problems that can not be solved, and everything is limited only by human fears.
I like to solve complex problems, put out fires and show myself what I'm capable of. 
Routine life is not interesting. Therefore, every task, even insignificant, must end with a victory. 
Seeing in the eyes of people from your team the desire for the next victory is an indescribable delight.
I am sure that I would take an active part in the achievement of the company's goals.
Thank you.
